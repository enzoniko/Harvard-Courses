Programs written in Python to import student data from a CSV file into a SQLite database, and then produce class rosters.

Hogwarts is in need of a student database. For years, the professors have been maintaing a CSV file containing all of the students’ names and houses and years. But that file didn’t make it particularly easy to get access to certain data, such as a roster of all the Ravenclaw students, or an alphabetical listing of the students enrolled at the school.

The import.py file imports all of the school’s data into a SQLite database, and the roster.py file gets house rosters for each of the houses of Hogwarts.
