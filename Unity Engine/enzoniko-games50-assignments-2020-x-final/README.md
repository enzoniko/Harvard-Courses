My game is called FEED HIM, it is a fun 3D game made with Unity. The main objective is to finish the game by passing through 10 Rounds before the time ends (blue bar). 
You achieve this by moving your player (WASD and SPACE, mouse for the camera control) to consume pink cubes (the player gets red when it did not consume anything, green when he
can feed the black hole and yellow when he can't consume more cubes) and feeding the black hole in the middle of the arena by pressing B close to it (avoiding falling 
into the abyss). You gain extra time while feeding the black hole and when passing through rounds, but each round shortens the maximum time and increases the amount of pink cubes 
you need to fill it completely.
This game has great graphics, I made the sounds using SFXR and the music my dad created, but this is just the first version I will improve it a lot in a close future.
I believe this game meets the complexity and distinctiveness levels required because it is totally original, contains clean and easy to read code, uses lots of new concepts 
like post-processing, reflection probes, etc.
It took me 3 weeks to finish this version of the game, I think the results look good and I learned a lot by searching better ways to do things in Unity, 
and most importantly I had lots of fun.

You can play the game by going to Build Versions/v1 and running the executable file.
