# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi, my project is a website called "BookKing", that welcomes you with an "about us" page, describing what the site does, and who made it. But to access the "search" page, the user must log in, both "register" and "log in" buttons are in the navigation bar at the top of all pages.
Besides these 3 pages, we also have the "search" page that appears only after the user log in, in this page the user can search books by title, author or ISBN. If the application finds books containing this description it will return a page called "results" where the user can find all books that are similar to what he searched and some information about it.
After that, the user can choose which book he wants to see more info about, by clicking in "go to book page" this action will take the user to other page called "books", that contains all data about the book chosen, an image of the books cape, and reviews that other users have written, he will also find a place where he can review and select a rating for it.
