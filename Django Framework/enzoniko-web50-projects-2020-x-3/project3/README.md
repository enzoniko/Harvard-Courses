This project is a fully funcional food ordering system made in django called PIZZ4U (Pizza for you).
Beside python I did use bootstrap 4 for better control of all DOMs elements.


index.hmlt login.html signin.html menu.html extends layout.html file 
my_orders.html and orders_manager shows list of all orders
models.py contain all data structures
urls.py contain routes to functions
views.py cotain main program and fuctions which renders html files

Also in static folder there are pictures and style.css file which contain additional styling for html, besides all the pre-made css and js files from bootstrap and jquery.

Program automatically create superuser account at first start (admin, adminadmin)

My personal touch is: Allowing site administrator to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders.
